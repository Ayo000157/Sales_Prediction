# Sales_Prediction
🧠 Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses Python and Machine Learning to predict future sales based on historical data. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions, identify trends, and plan effectively for upcoming sales periods.
🚀 Project Overview
The Sales Prediction model is built using Linear Regression (or whichever model you used e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.) to predict sales based on key features such as:
	•	Advertising spend
	•	Product price
	•	Marketing data
	•	Location or store type
	•	Customer behavior
You can easily customize the dataset and improve the model accuracy with additional features.
